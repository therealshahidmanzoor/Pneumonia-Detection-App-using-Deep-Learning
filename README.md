The pneumonia detection system provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for end users.
Here's a detailed description of how the system works:
1. Image Input:
a. Users can upload chest X-ray images through a user interface (UI) on the web
application.
b. The UI allows users to navigate to their local files and select the X-ray image for
analysis.
2. Image Processing:
a. Once the image is uploaded, the backend of the application preprocesses the image by
resizing and normalizing it to match the requirements of the trained model.
3. Model Inference:
a. The preprocessed image is then fed into the trained CNN model for inference.
b. The model utilizes its learned features to predict whether the X-ray indicates a normal
condition or the presence of pneumonia.
4. Result Presentation:
a. The prediction result is presented to the user in a clear and interpretable format.
b. The system communicates whether the X-ray shows normal conditions or if
pneumonia is detected.
5. Feedback and Further Action:
a. Users receive actionable insights based on the model's prediction.
b. In the case of pneumonia detection, users are advised to consult with medical
professionals for further diagnosis and treatment.
6. User-Friendly Interface:
a. The web application is designed with an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring
that individuals without specialized technical knowledge can easily use the system.
b. Clear instructions and feedback are provided to guide users through the process.
7. Accessibility:
a. The application is accessible through web browsers, eliminating the need for users to
install additional software.
